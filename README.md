### ðŸ’» Dotfiles your computer.

* I created my repo to store all my dotfiles like .bashrc, .zsrch, .vscode etc. In case I work on another machine or something happens on my machine, It is really easy for me to setup a new development machine.

 - I am currently using mac as my development machine so all the mac specific files are store in mac folder.

âœ… I will be keeping this repo up to date when ever I change something in my dotfiles or when I decide to move to another operating system entirely.
